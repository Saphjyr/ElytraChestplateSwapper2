# Elytra/Chestplate Swapper 2

A simple quality of life mod that swaps between chestplate and elytra on a keystroke.

## How to use it

The default key is "grave accent" ("Â²" on the AZERTY layout) but it can be changed in the options of the game.  
It can be triggered outside of the inventory and inside too. 

## Requirements

This mod requires the Fabric API

## Disclaimer

Some public servers do not allow this kind of mods and can detect them if it is used in some circumstances (spam the key, swap while pressing a movement key). You should check the server's rules before using it on a public server. I am not responsible for the consequences of inappropriate use of this mod.
